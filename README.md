# GlimmerDev's Unofficial Mods Updates 
Updates for Stardew mods that I am not the original author of. These should be considered "maintanence" updates only, unless otherwise specified. (The main goal of these updates are to keep the mods compatible and non-broken.)

In some cases, the mod author might have already published the source code on Github. For those mods, this repo serves as a mirror of the code in the pull request made to the original repo.
