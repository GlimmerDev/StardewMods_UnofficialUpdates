## About
This mod adds Steve Harrington from Stranger Things into your game! He is a dateable & marriable NPC, complete with a ~~custom spouse room~~ (not fixed yet) and festival locations.

The original mod did not include the spouse room and festival locations by default. This version integrates both, as well as completing all heart events.

Other fixes include schedule & dialogue tweaks, sprite alignment, and generally just making it compatible with Stardew 1.6.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the following mods installed:
    * SMAPI
    * Content Patcher
2. Download the mod and unzip it. Then put it into your mods folder.
3. Done!

## Errors

* Steve will show up for festivals but when the main festival events happen, he disappears.  
For example, at the flower festival, he will be standing there, but when the dance happens Steve suddenly disappears.

## Compatability

~~Steve is not compatible with other npc mods (But does work with Stardew Valley Expanded!).
For example, if you downloaded another npc mod it wouldn't show up in game because the files have already been edited by Steve's NPC.~~

## Things that will be updated in future?

* Tweaks to Steve's portrait
* ~~Custom 10 heart event~~
* Tweaks to Steve's schedule - will spend more time in the mines
* ~~Animations! Which I can't get to work at the moment but will at some point!~~

Huge shout out to WatchfulTigerlily for creating the original version of this mod. I just keep it up to date, most assets and data comes straight from their version.
